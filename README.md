# Hello Microverse

> In this project, I set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding is required in this exercise. My goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices I've learned about in previous steps. You will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in your future job as well, so it is important to know them!


## Built With

- Html and CSS
- Visual studio code (IDE)
